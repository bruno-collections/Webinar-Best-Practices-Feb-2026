    # 🏃 Section 6: Collection Runner

    The Collection Runner lets you execute multiple requests in sequence — and with **data files**, you can run the same requests multiple times with different data!

    In this section, you will:

    - ✅ Use data file variables in request URLs and bodies
    - ✅ Run a folder using the Collection Runner
    - ✅ Use a JSON data file for data-driven testing
    - ✅ See how requests execute in sequence order

    📌 Make sure the **Workshop** environment is selected from the dropdown (top right).

    ### 📋 Requests in This Section

    ---

    **🔹 Create User** — POST user data to the echo server
    - Sends a JSON body with `name` and `website` fields using data file variables
    - 🎯 **Your task:** The body has empty `{{}}` placeholders — fill in the correct **data file variable names**
    - 💡 **Hint:** Look at `users.json` in the collection root to see the available column names
    - Assertions are already set up to verify the echoed response

    ---

    **🔹 Verify Creation** — GET a user by ID from JSONPlaceholder
    - Fetches a user to demonstrate that requests run in **sequence order** (Create User first, then Verify Creation)
    - 🎯 **Your task:** The URL has an empty `{{}}` — fill in the correct variable name to look up the user by ID
    - 💡 **Hint:** Which column in `users.json` contains the user's ID?
    - Also demonstrates `res.responseTime` assertions for performance checks

    ### 🏃 Using the Collection Runner

    Once you've filled in the placeholders:

    1. **Without a data file:** Right-click on the `06-Collection Runner` folder → **Run** — both requests execute in sequence
    2. **With a data file:** In the runner dialog, check **Run with Parameters** → select **JSON** → choose `users.json` from the collection root
    3. The runner will iterate **5 times** (once per user in the JSON file), replacing `{{name}}`, `{{website}}`, and `{{id}}` with each row's values 🎉

    ---

    ### 📁 Data File

    📄 **users.json** — located at the collection root, contains 5 users from JSONPlaceholder:
    - Columns: `id`, `name`, `website`
    - Each object becomes one iteration of the collection run
    - Variables are accessed as `{{id}}`, `{{name}}`, `{{website}}` in URLs and bodies

    ---

    ### 📂 Solution Folder

    The **Solution** subfolder contains fully working versions with all placeholders filled in.

    **Solution requests:**
    - ✅ **Create User** — uses `{{name}}` and `{{website}}` from the data file
    - ✅ **Verify Creation** — uses `{{id}}` to fetch the correct user

    ---

    ### 📌 Key Concepts

    - **Collection Runner** — execute all requests in a folder in sequence order
    - **Data-driven testing** — use JSON (or CSV) files to run the same requests with different data per iteration
    - **Data file variables** — keys in the JSON objects become `{{variableName}}` placeholders
    - **Sequence order** — requests run in their `seq` order (seq 1 first, seq 2 second, etc.)
    - **Performance assertions** — use `res.responseTime` to assert on response speed
