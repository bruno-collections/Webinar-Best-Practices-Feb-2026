    # 🚀 Section 1: Getting Started

    👋 Welcome to the **Bruno Live Workshop!**

    In this section, you will:

    - ✅ Send a POST request to Bruno's echo server
    - ✅ Send GET requests to public APIs
    - ✅ Explore JSON responses
    - ✅ Learn about environment variables in URLs

    ### 📌 Prerequisites

    - Bruno is installed and running
    - You have opened this collection in Bruno
    - Select the **Workshop** environment from the environment dropdown (top right)

    ---

    ### 📋 Requests in This Section

    Each request below is **intentionally incomplete** — follow along with the instructor to fix them!

    ---

    **🔹 Hello Echo** — POST to Bruno's echo server
    - The echo server mirrors back whatever JSON you send it
    - 🎯 **Your task:** The JSON body has empty values — fill them in with something meaningful and click **Send** ▶️
    - Explore the response to see how the echo server works

    ---

    **🔹 Get Dog Facts** — GET request to a public API
    - This request fetches a random dog fact from the Dog API
    - ✅ This one is ready to go — just click **Send** ▶️ and explore the response
    - Notice the structured JSON response with `id`, `type`, and `attributes.body`

    ---

    **🔹 Get All Users** — GET request to JSONPlaceholder
    - Fetches all users from the JSONPlaceholder API
    - 🎯 **Your task:** Look at the URL — something could be improved here. Can you spot what should use an **environment variable** instead?
    - 💡 **Hint:** Compare this URL to the one in "Get Dog Facts" — how does that request reference its base URL?

    ---

    ### 📁 Solution Folder

    The **Solution** subfolder contains fully working versions of all requests. If you get stuck, open them as a reference!

    **Solution requests:**
    - ✅ **Hello Echo** — complete with filled-in JSON body
    - ✅ **Get Dog Facts** — complete and working
    - ✅ **Get All Users** — uses `{{baseUrl}}` environment variable

    ---

    ### 📌 Key Concepts

    - **Environment variables** like `{{baseUrl}}` and `{{echoUrl}}` let you reuse URLs across requests — we'll explore these more in the next section
    - **POST requests** send data in the body; **GET requests** retrieve data
    - Bruno auto-formats JSON responses for easy reading
