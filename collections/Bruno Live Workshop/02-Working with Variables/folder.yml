    # 📦 Section 2: Working with Variables

    Now that you can send requests, let's explore **environments** and **variables** — the backbone of reusable API collections.

    In this section, you will:

    - ✅ Use environment variables (`{{baseUrl}}`, `{{defaultUserId}}`)
    - ✅ Use Bruno's built-in dynamic variables (`{{$randomFullName}}`, `{{$randomEmail}}`)
    - ✅ Send POST and PUT requests with JSON bodies
    - ✅ Switch between environments and see values change

    📌 Make sure the **Workshop** environment is selected from the dropdown (top right).

    ### 📋 Requests in This Section

    Each request has **intentionally missing or incorrect variable references** — follow along with the instructor to fix them!

    ---

    **🔹 Create a Post** — POST request to create a new resource
    - Sends a JSON body with title, body, and userId
    - 🎯 **Your task:** The `userId` field has a hardcoded value — replace it with the correct **environment variable**
    - 💡 **Hint:** Check the Workshop environment to see which variable holds the default user ID
    - **Expected:** Status `201 Created` with the new post data

    ---

    **🔹 Echo with Variables** — POST request showcasing different variable types
    - Demonstrates both **environment variables** and **dynamic variables** side by side
    - 🎯 **Your task:** The body has empty `{{}}` placeholders — fill in the correct variable names
    - 💡 **Hint:** You'll need one environment variable and several dynamic variables (starting with `$`)
    - **Try it:** Send multiple times to see dynamic values change, then switch environments!

    ---

    **🔹 Update a Post** — PUT request to update an existing resource
    - Sends the full updated resource in the JSON body
    - 🎯 **Your task:** The `userId` field in the body has an empty `{{}}` — fill in the correct variable (hint it won't come from your 'normal' variable types)
    - **Expected:** Status `200 OK` with the updated post data

    ---

    ### 📁 Solution Folder

    The **Solution** subfolder contains fully working versions with all variables correctly referenced.

    **Solution requests:**
    - ✅ **Create a Post** — uses `{{defaultUserId}}` for the userId
    - ✅ **Echo with Variables** — demonstrates `{{appName}}`, `{{$randomFullName}}`, `{{$randomEmail}}`, and `{{$randomJobTitle}}`
    - ✅ **Update a Post** — complete with proper variable usage

    ---

    ### 📌 Key Concepts

    - **Environment variables** (`{{baseUrl}}`, `{{defaultUserId}}`) — defined per environment, great for switching between dev/staging/prod
    - **Dynamic variables** (`{{$randomFullName}}`, `{{$randomEmail}}`) — built into Bruno, generate fresh random values on every request
    - Open the **Environment Editor** to inspect and modify variable values
